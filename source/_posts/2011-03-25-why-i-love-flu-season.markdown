so my kick-ass job lets me work 4 10 hr days, only, this week, due to flu-related absenteeism, they asked me to come in to cover so we didn’t fall behind on service level.

6.5 hrs at double-time working in a laid-back department with some of the most hilarious people i know, after I’ve already had 2 days off? count me in!

oh, and did i mention my boss bought me a sushi lunch for coming in? yeah, life is good. let me hear your yodel.
