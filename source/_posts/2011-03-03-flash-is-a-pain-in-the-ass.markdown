i hate flash. just about everybody out there with an informed opinion knows that it is full of bugs and problems. <!--more-->be that as it may, flash is the number one delivery vehicle for rich media on the internet.

i think the discussion in this bug is a perfect reflection of one of the greatest strengths, and the greatest weaknesses in linux.

strength: quality, _technically correct_ and cutting-edge code<br/>
weakness: _terrible_ user experience

since my distro-of-the-day is Fedora (i miss you crunchbang, but my wireless card is a piece of shit), i have mixed feelings about this. i ultimately agree with the developers who say that this is in fact a bug in flash itself, but! this is a terrible user experience. 
flash remains an important part of web communication, no matter how unfortunate the fact may be. admittedly, fedora has never made any bones about the fact that it exists for contributors, and is not particularly focused on user experience beyond ensuring rock-solid stability. but for those of us without the programming capability to contribute lines of code (and i'm sure we comprise the majority of the user-base, regardless of fedora's official stance), who "contribute" by filing bug reports, this was a discouraging exchange. 

i have mixed feelings, best summed up as "understood, agreed, but disappointed".
