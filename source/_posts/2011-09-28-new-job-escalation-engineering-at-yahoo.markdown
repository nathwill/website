Well, this is my first real post in several months, but I wanted to take a moment to bring things up to date.<!--more-->
My new wife and I are greatly enjoying the calm after the storm, and are getting our lives back in order now that the pressures of the wedding are behind us. Now if only we could motivate ourselves to finish up those thank-you cards!

In the last few weeks we've both been pretty focused on work, and I was extremely happy to find out today that I was selected for a change in position that I applied for. I'll be moving into a 50/50 role for a while spending about half my time working escalated tickets, and the remainder working on familiarizing myself with the code base with the goal of producing bug fixes.

I'm very much looking forward to growing into the new position, and excited to go through training. The new job involves a healthy dose of decsion-making authority over the prioritization of bug-fixes. I look forward to being challenged to resolve some of the niggling problems that are within the scope of my capabilities.

More to come.
