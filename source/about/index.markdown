<p>My name is Nathan Williams and I am an Escalation Engineer at <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Small Business</a>. I&#8217;ve been doing *nix systems administration for nearly 5 years, and have been loving every minute of it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also a student, working towards a BS in Computer Science. I attend Portland Community College, and will be transfering to Portland State University in Oregon to complete the degree.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a perpetual tinkerer, who enjoys coming up with new answers for managing routine problems. I believe the simple, elegant solution is always the right one.</p>

<p>I do web development for friends and for work, when a project strikes me as posing a unique challenge, or is for a good cause.</p>

<p>If you need to contact me about anything on this site, you can email me, nathan@, or reach me on identi.ca, @nathwill.</p>
